# XLIFFPhoenix
XLIFF Phoenix compares XLIFF documents contained in a Localisation Memory Container (LMC),  with an unlocalised XLIFF file introduced into the system, and leverages the coincident translation units along with their correspondent metadata (origin, source and target, language, etc); both the data and metadata are introduced inside the alternative translation unit element.
